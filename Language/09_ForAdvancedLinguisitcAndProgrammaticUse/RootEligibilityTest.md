# 🧪 Lingua Sona — Root Eligibility Test

This document defines the **formal decision process** for determining whether a concept deserves an **atomic lexical root** or must be expressed via compounding, classifiers, or derivation.

The goal is to preserve **lexical compression**, **learnability**, and **semantic clarity**.

---

## Rule Zero (Non-Negotiable)

> If a concept can be expressed cleanly using **HI / WI** and existing roots, it **must not** receive a new root.

---

## Gate 1 — Frequency Test (REQUIRED)

**Question:** Will an average speaker use this concept **weekly or more**?

- ❌ No → Reject (compound only)
- ✅ Yes → Continue

---

## Gate 2 — Atomicity Test (REQUIRED)

**Question:** Can the meaning be constructed without loss or ambiguity using existing roots?

- ✅ Yes → Reject (compound)
- ❌ No → Continue

---

## Gate 3 — Cross-Domain Utility (REQUIRED)

**Question:** Does the concept appear across **multiple domains** (e.g., body + mind, social + legal)?

- ❌ Single niche → Reject
- ✅ Multi-domain → Continue

---

## Gate 4 — Cognitive Primitiveness (STRONG)

**Question:** Is the concept intuitively understood without referencing another abstraction?

- ❌ Requires explanation → Defer to compound
- ✅ Primitive → Continue

---

## Gate 5 — Cultural Neutrality (STRONG)

**Question:** Is the concept present across most human cultures?

- ❌ Culture-bound → Reject or derive
- ✅ Universal → Continue

---

## Gate 6 — Compression Value (OPTIONAL)

**Question:** Does assigning a root significantly reduce sentence length or complexity **repeatedly**?

- ❌ Rare benefit → Weak candidate
- ✅ Frequent benefit → Strong candidate

---

## Gate 7 — Ambiguity Risk (FINAL CHECK)

**Question:** Will this root introduce dangerous ambiguity if unclassified?

- ❌ Yes → Require classifier or reject
- ✅ No → Approve

---

## Outcomes

| Result | Action |
|------|--------|
| Passes all required gates | Atomic root (1–3 letters) |
| Fails any required gate | HI/WI compound |
| High ambiguity risk | Root requires Z-classifier |
| Culture-specific | Derived or contextual term |

---

## Design Enforcement Rule

> For every **new root added beyond the soft limit**, **ten existing roots must be removed or merged**.

This rule prevents emotional or aesthetic drift and enforces long-term linguistic discipline.
