# Common Fraction Terms
### *Lingua Sona Modular Fraction Morphology*

Fractions in **Lingua Sona** are represented using short, phonotactically legal terms that follow consistent morphological families. These forms are used when expressing **partial color contributions**, **proportional descriptors**, **gradients**, and other ratio-based constructions throughout the language.

Each term is designed for:
- **One-stroke glyph compatibility**
- **Phonetic distinctiveness**
- **Systematic symmetry**
- **Ease of compounding**, especially with color channels such as `(li)(ma)(mi)(mo)`.

## 1. Most Common Fractions (Quarters and Thirds)

| Fraction | Term       | Notes          |
| -------- | ---------- | -------------- |
| **¼**    | **(kan)**  | Quarter        |
| **½**    | **(har)**  | Half           |
| **¾**    | **(kane)** | Three-quarters |
| **⅓**    | **(tan)**  | Third          |
| **⅔**    | **(tane)** | Two-thirds     |

These form the foundational **K-series** (quarters) and **T-series** (thirds).

---

## 2. H-Series (Eighth Fractions)
*Halves of quarters; derived from the H-family to avoid collision with K-series.*

| Fraction | Term       | Notes                                |
| -------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ |
| **⅛**    | **(hak)**  | Small, sharp form; parallels *(kan)* |
| **⅜**    | **(hake)** | Morphologically mirrors *(kane)*     |
| **⅝**    | **(hami)** | Midpoint eighth                      |
| **⅞**    | **(hane)** | Symmetric “near-whole” eighth        |

H-series is used for finer gradients, shading, and reduced-intensity color blends.

---

## 3. F-Series (Fifth Fractions)
*Selected because “F” is unused in existing fraction morphology and distinct in sound.*

| Fraction | Term | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **⅕** | **(fan)** | Fifth |
| **⅖** | **(fane)** | One step above |
| **⅗** | **(femi)** | Middle fifth |
| **⅘** | **(faneh)** | Near-whole fifth; “h” adds soft attenuation |

Useful for describing subtle ratios and perceptual color gradations.

---

## 4. T-Series Extensions (Sixths)
*Sixths relate to thirds, so derived from the T-family.*

| Fraction | Term | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **⅙** | **(tah)** | Reduced third |
| **⅚** | **(tame)** | Complement to *(tah)* |

These are used sparingly, mostly in precise tonal or intensity contexts.

---

## 5. P-Series (Selective Tenths)
*Tenths are rarely needed linguistically, so only useful forms are included.*

| Fraction | Term | Notes |
|---------|-------|-------|
| **¹⁄₁₀** | **(pan)** | Minor quantity |
| **³⁄₁₀** | **(pane)** | Comparable structure to *(kane)* |
| **⁷⁄₁₀** | **(pami)** | “Over-middle” tenth; phonetically distinct |

Tenths appear primarily in UI design, audio mixing, and brightness scaling.

## 6. Summary Table (All Fraction Families)

| Family       | Fractions        | Example Terms                  |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **K-series** | ¼, ¾             | (kan), (kane)                  |
| **T-series** | ⅓, ⅔, ⅙, ⅚       | (tan), (tane), (tah), (tame)   |
| **H-series** | ⅛, ⅜, ⅝, ⅞       | (hak), (hake), (hami), (hane)  |
| **F-series** | ⅕, ⅖, ⅗, ⅘       | (fan), (fane), (femi), (faneh) |
| **P-series** | ¹⁄₁₀, ³⁄₁₀, ⁷⁄₁₀ | (pan), (pane), (pami)          |
