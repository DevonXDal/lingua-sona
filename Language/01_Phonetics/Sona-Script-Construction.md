# Sona Script - Letters of Lingua Sona

## Acceptable Forms of Letters
- (consonant)(vowel): Common structure of the letters. A consonant-type sound followed by a vowel-type sound. 
- ¬(vowel): Only allowed as the first letter of a word outside of proper noun usage. 
- (consonant)¬: Only allowed as the last letter of a word outside of proper noun usage. 
- Exceptions:
	- **U**: when alone is depicted as an en dash. It is used for "strong bindings" and can appear in the middle of words when used for said purpose.
	- **UN**: when alone is depicted as an em dash. It is used for "loose bindings" and likewise can appear when to concatenating loosely bound words.
	- Although non-standard, they can use their ¬(vowel) form in writing. This is likely to be more common when being used for proper nouns. Either way is correct but dash form is preferential for bindings as it is more clear at a glance.

## Letter Assembly
When a letter has both a consonant-type sound and a vowel-type sound combined, the consonant precedes the vowel and their glyphs tie into each other via what you can imagine as a imaginary central binding point that glues the two glyphs together.

When a letter has a vowel-type sound only, it is preceded by a ¬ (logical negation) glyph. The bottom-right side of this negation glyph strikes against that same imaginary central binding point. 

When a letter has a consonant-type sound, then the consonant is followed by that ¬ (logical negation) with the top-left side of this negation glyph striking against that very same imaginary central binding point. 

This imaginary central point's purpose allows the full letter to be written without lifting the writing utensil as a single stroke for the whole of each letter is all that is necessary.
