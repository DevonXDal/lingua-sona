# Negation of Glyphs within Letters
## Why
A number of [[Letters]] lack either a consonant or vowel sound to form them. When this is the case, the Latin depiction of the letter fills in the spot with a logical negation symbol (**¬**) to show it is unused more clearly. 

Additionally this symbol is depicted as part of the letters that lack either end of the sound to form them.  This helps to further ensure clarity that only a part of the sound is to be made rather than being omitted for potential linguistic choices. 

## The Symbol
Negation of either side uses the *Logical Negation Symbol in Unicode* **¬**

## Depiction of the Symbol
For writing [[Letters]] where part is negated, the side without that fragment of the phonetic sound has the symbol written. On the consonant side, the symbol starts elevated and then sinks down into the imaginary middle binding point of the letter. On the vowel side, the left most point of the symbol extends out from that same imaginary middle binding point. Meaning that if a letter with both sides negated were to be possible, the result would resemble a stair case.
