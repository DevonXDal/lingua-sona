# Numbers and Forms
## Basic Numbers
- 0 → HO
- 1 → ¬U_N¬ (UN)
- 2 → TU
- 3 → TI
- 4 → KO
- 5 → FI
- 6 → SE
- 7 → SAI
- 8 → WO
- 9 → NU
- 10 → TE
  
## Extended Numbers
*Extended numbers follow Swahili-style lexical stacking. WI use after multiplication is strictly optional but may be helpful for new learners.*

For **11-19**, aim to do it like saying 14 is 10 + 4 or TE_KO. In other words, append it after. 

For multiplicatives like 10s, 100s, etc., precede/prepend the number to which to multiply the other number by:
- 20 → TU_TE
- 30 → TI_TE
- 40 → KO_TE
- 50 → FI_TE
- 60 → SE_TE
- 70 → SAI_TE
- 80 → WO_TE
- 90 → NU_TE

For more complex numbers. 
For the hundreds place, use HE for 100. So TE is 10. HE is 100.

Past that. For thousand and greater levels for which sets of three zeros would be used, follow the multiplicative format with HI being used to strongly bind the levels with HOOO:
- Thousand → HOOO  - 1x(000) 
- Million → TU_HI_HOOO - 2x(000)
- Billion → TI_HI_HOOO - 3x (000)

***As for an extreme example, let's do the number 172, 484, 483, 000, 340, 210, 000, 000, 013***:
In English, this is *One-Hundred Septillion, Four-Hundred-Eighty-Four Sextillion, Four-Hundred-Eighty-Three Quintillion, Three-Hundred-Forty Trillion, Two-Hundred-Ten Billion, and Thirteen.*
**Letters:** ~152
**Syllables:** ~45

Now let's show it in Lingua Sona (Latin Version):
*(HE SAI_TE TU) WO_HI_HOOO (KO_HE WO_TE KO) SAI_HI_HOOO (KO_HE WO_TE TI) SE_HI_HOOO, (TI_HE KO_TE) KO_HI_HOOO (TU_HE TE) TI_HI_HOOO TE TI.*
**Letters:** ~38
**Syllables:** ~38

## Chunking for Clarity
When showing such large numbers, feel free to "chunk the number segments"
**Chunk = (A_HE) [WI] (B_TE) [WI] (C)**  
Left-to-right, omission allowed (e.g., no units, no tens).
WI can optionally be used for new learners as depicted here, but fluent speakers will typically drop it for ease of speaking and writing.

*let A = Number of Hundreds*
*let B = Numbers of Tens*
*let C = Units/Single-Digits*
`CHUNK := [A_HE] [WI] [B_TE] [WI] [C]`
## Negative Numbers
To do negative numbers. Use the negating classifier Z¬ before the number. 

-346 is written as **Z¬ TI_HE KO_TE SE**

## Decimal Numbers
Combine the number before and after the decimal place by using ¬e (and) where the decimal place would be stated when speaking it or transcribing it as words not numerals.

26.54 is written as TU_TE SE ¬E FI_TE KO
## Fractions
To state a fraction, simply use the word for "over" which is PO in a Numerator → PO → Denominator format. Literally.. Numerator *over* Denominator. 

- 1/2 → UN PO TU
- 3/4 → TI PO KO
- 17/24 → TE SAI PO TU TE KO

## Ordinals
For ordinals, precede with the adjective classifier. ZU. 

To say it is the 23rd, write it as ZU TU_TE TI.
