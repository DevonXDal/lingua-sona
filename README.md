# 🌐 Lingua Sona: The Language of Wisdom

**Lingua Sona** (formerly *Toki Sona*) is a constructed language (conlang) built to explore what a truly universal, logically structured, and aesthetically pleasing language could look like.

---

## ✨ Overview
Lingua Sona literally means **“Language of Wisdom”** or **“Language of Knowledge.”**  
It is designed to be concise, phonetic, and globally approachable—capable of being used for **everyday conversation, programming, mathematics, and formal documentation** alike.

---

## 🧬 Core Inspirations
Lingua Sona draws linguistic and structural inspiration from:
- **French** – grammatical and sentence flow  
- **Swahili** – prefix/suffix clarity and fluid morphology  
- **Toki Pona / Toki Ma** – simplicity and conceptual grounding  

Originally named **Toki Sona**, the project grew beyond its roots into a language of its own design. 

---

## 🎯 Project Goals
Lingua Sona aims to:

- 🌍 Be a legitimate **“World Language” candidate**  
- 🧑‍💼 Function across both **personal and professional** contexts  
- 🔢 Support **mathematics and programming** natively (Base 2/10/16, logical notation, etc.)  
- 📘 Stay within a **soft limit of 1,250 terms** and a **hard limit of 1,750 terms**  
- 🧩 Maintain **consistent grammar and phonetic logic**  
- 🔊 Allow listeners to **spell what they hear** with near-perfect accuracy  
- 💬 Require **evidentiality** (source of information) for factual statements  
- ✍️ Optimize **writing density**—more meaning in fewer characters  
- 🧠 Use symbols that **mirror pronunciation and mouth shape** for intuitive learning  

---

## 🧰 Tools & Infrastructure
Lingua Sona is developed using:
- 🪶 **Obsidian** → for structured Markdown documentation  
- 📊 **PlantUML** → to model grammar, sentence logic, and linguistic automata (e.g. DFA diagrams)  
- 🧾 **LibreOffice** → for professional formatting, publication drafts, and academic presentation  

---

## 🧩 Design Highlights
- **Phonetic Alphabet** – letters shaped to resemble the physical articulation of their sounds.  
- **Context Clues System (Za/Ze/Zi/Zo/Zu)** – every word’s type (person, place, object, verb, adjective, concept, etc.) is contextually encoded.  
- **Mathematical Integration** – supports arithmetic, calculus, logic, and advanced operators natively.  
- **Programming-Ready Syntax** – readable both by humans and parsers.  

---

## 📈 Current Stage
- ✅ Number system complete (Base 2, 10, 16)  
- ✅ Phonetic alphabet in Unicode PUA range  
- 🧮 Mathematical symbols and logical operators defined  
- 🧠 Vocabulary expansion in progress  
- 📘 Grammar formalization using PlantUML and Markdown

## 🗺️ Roadmap
| Phase | Goal | Status |
|-------|------|--------|
| I | Phonetic alphabet design | ✅ Done |
| II | Core grammar & suffix rules | 🧠 In progress |
| III | Number system & operators | ✅ Done |

## 🧭 Vision
> “Logic given voice."
> — *Lingua Sona Manifesto*

Lingua Sona seeks to demonstrate that a global, inclusive, logical, and beautiful language is not only possible—but *inevitable.*

You may have already noticed but this project uses AI to assist its development. First, to make things easier to digest, allowing time to be focused on the actual language construction. Second to quickly catch rule breaks in the language's construction. Third, to fine-tune the depiction of characters used with this language (remove odd curves and to create vectors for font use easier) And lastly to aid in the brainstorming process.
### 🧭 Long-Term Vision
> **Lingua Sona** seeks not only to simplify communication,  
> but to *unify human understanding* through clarity, logic, and beauty.  
> It is not just a conlang — it is a blueprint for linguistic evolution.
