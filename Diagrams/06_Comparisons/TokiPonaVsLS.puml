title Toki Pona vs Lingua Sona — Scalability

package "Toki Pona" {
  [~120 Root Words]
  [Extreme Ambiguity]
  [Context by Convention]
}

package "Lingua Sona" {
  [Bounded Lexicon]
  [Classifier System]
  [Compound Logic]
}

[~120 Root Words] --> [High Context Load]
[Extreme Ambiguity] --> [Cultural Dependence]

[Classifier System] --> [Controlled Meaning]
[Compound Logic] --> [Scalable Vocabulary]

note right of [Compound Logic]
Complex ideas grow
without lexical explosion.
end note
