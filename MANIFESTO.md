# 🕊️ Lingua Sona Manifesto  
### “Logic given voice.”

**Lingua Sona** is not only a language. It is a demonstration of what communication can become when logic and empathy meet design.  
It was born from the limits of *Toki Pona*, refined through the grammar of *French* and *Swahili*, and structured with the precision of *mathematics*.

## 🔥 Core Beliefs

1. **Clarity is compassion.**  
   Understanding ends conflict. The clearer the tongue, the closer the minds.

2. **Logic deserves sound.**  
   Every rule, every relationship, every symbol must have a voice that matches its function.

3. **Simplicity is power.**  
   A smaller lexicon is not weakness—it is mastery through compression.

4. **Truth must declare its source.**  
   No statement of fact stands without its *evidentiality*. Knowledge carries responsibility.

5. **Accessibility precedes adoption.**  
   Any human mouth should speak it; any human ear should learn it.

## 🧩 Guiding Principles

| Domain | Principle | Expression |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| **Design** | Phonetic, consistent, algorithmic | One sound = one symbol |
| **Education** | Learnable through logic | Grammar as pattern recognition |
| **Technology** | Machine-readable & human-beautiful | Code and poetry in the same syntax |
| **Culture** | Global neutrality | Drawn from many tongues, biased toward none |
| **Ethos** | Evidence over opinion | Every fact has an origin marker |

## 🌍 Vision

To craft a *world language* worthy of the term—  
one concise enough for thought, expressive enough for feeling,  
precise enough for science, and beautiful enough for art.
