# 💠 Funding & Support

Lingua Sona is an open, long-term language design project focused on clarity, logic, and global usability.  
Financial support is **optional** and exists solely to help sustain development over extended timelines.

This document explains **how funds are used**, **what support does and does not imply**, and **how transparency is maintained**.

## 🧭 Core Principles

- Lingua Sona remains **open and free to use**
- Financial support does **not** grant control, ownership, or influence
- Linguistic decisions are made by maintainers based on design integrity, not funding
- Sustainability matters more than speed

---

## 💰 How Funds Are Allocated

All incoming funds are divided using a fixed allocation model:

### **80% — Project Reinvestment**
Used exclusively for project-related needs, including but not limited to:

- Documentation and educational materials
- Fonts, glyph design, and visual assets
- Tooling and infrastructure (repositories, hosting, automation)
- Research, testing, and formalization work
- Preparation for long-term goals (e.g., Unicode proposals, academic formatting)

### **20% — Contributor Support**
Used to support the core maintainers so the project remains sustainable:

- Modest compensation for time spent maintaining and developing the language
- Development tools and professional software
- AI-assisted tooling used for drafting, auditing, and refinement

This portion exists to prevent burnout and allow consistent progress without turning Lingua Sona into a commercial product.

## 🚫 What Funding Does *Not* Buy

Financial support does **not** provide:

- Ownership or equity
- Voting rights or governance control
- Priority access or exclusive content
- Influence over language rules, structure, or roadmap

Lingua Sona is guided by its manifesto and internal logic—not by donors.

## 🌱 Why Support Exists

Building a serious, internally consistent language system is slow, careful work.  
Support allows contributors to focus on quality and longevity rather than urgency or monetization pressure.

> Support is appreciated, optional, and never required.

---

## 🔍 Transparency

High-level summaries of funded activity may be shared periodically.  
This project prioritizes **clarity without bureaucracy**—enough visibility to build trust, without turning funding into a burden.

## 📜 License Reminder

Lingua Sona materials are licensed under **CC BY-SA 4.0** unless otherwise noted.  
Funding does not alter licensing terms.

**Logic given voice — sustained by those who value clarity.**
